            <p>Hey guys! My name is Priyanshu Goyal. I am a first year undergrad pursuing BTech in Maths & Computing at IIT Hyderabad. I am a learning programmer and web developer. I give coding contests on platforms like codechef and codeforces to improve my problem solving and logical reasoning skills. I am looking for a project in web development to gain some practice and hands on experience in real world applications.
            I made this website as my project for lambda. This website is made using React for frontend and express for backend. The database for the website is hosted on MongoDb atlas.</p>
